## Method

1. Gently melt `butter` in saucepan.
1. Add `garlic` and cook until very lightly browned, about 30 secs.
1. Add in `flour`, `oregano`, `salt`, and `pepper`. Combine well.
1. Slowly whisk in `milk`.
1. Cook on low until desired thickness is achieved, whisking constantly.
1. Remove from heat and stir in `parmesan`.
1. Use immediately or cover and chill.

## Notes

- Sauce has a habit of becoming obnoxiously thick. Cut with extra `milk` if needed.
- Goes great on cast iron pizzas! Add some `chicken`, `bacon`, `red onion`, and `tomatoes` for a classic club pizza.
