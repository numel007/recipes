1. `Remove skin` from chiles when cooled. `Remove skin` from garlic.
1. Blend roasted items with `jalapenos.`
1. Season and sear `pork shoulder` on all sides, then remove.
1. Cook `onions and minced garlic` in remaining fat.
1. Move to a large pot or pan, combine `onions`, `oregano`, `chile verde sauce`, and `pork`.
1. Add enough `chicken stock` to cover meat.

### _Notes & Comments_

- Do NOT underbroil the `tomatillos`. The ending sauce will be very tart.
