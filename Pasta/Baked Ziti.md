_Yield: ~1 9x13 inch pan_

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 375F. Grease a 9x13 pan.
1. In a large pot, heat `olive oil`, then add `meats` and sear `2-3 mins`.
1. Flip `meats` and sear again . Break up into bits.
1. Cook `meats` on medium until fat renders and `meat` is slightly browned.
1. Remove `meats` and add in `sweet onion`. Cook with `salt & pepper` until almost done, then add `garlic` and briefly fry.
1. Add back `meats`, then add `crushed tomatoes`. Simmer `5 mins`. Add `0.75 tbsp ` sugar to reduce tomato acidity if needed.
1. Meanwhile, cook `ziti` in salted water until slightly under al-dente.
1. Combine `cooked ziti` with `sauce.` Separately, combine all cheese.
