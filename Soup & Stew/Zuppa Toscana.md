_Yield: ~6 servings_

## Method

1. Cook `sausage` and confit `bacon`. Add to a slow cooker.
1. Remove all but 1 tbsp of oil from pan and toast `red pepper flakes`.
1. Add `onions` and saute until softened, then add `garlic` and cook until fragrant.
1. Transfer `onions` to slow cooker. Add `potatoes` and `chicken stock` to cover.
1. Season with `2 tsp salt and 1 tsp black pepper`.
1. Cook on `high for 4 hours`.
1. Add `spinach` and cook additional `30 mins`.
1. Turn off slow cooker and add `heavy cream` before serving.
1. Season to taste with more `salt and pepper`.

## Notes

- Do not add `heavy cream` while the soup is overly hot. It will curdle.
- Leaving skins on `potatoes` is nice, but cooking time will dramatically increase.
