## Method

1. Mix all `ingredients` until a rough ball forms.
1. Cover and let stand `5 mins`.
1. With a `wet hand`, stretch and fold dough on all 4 sides, then `flip dough over`.
1. Repeat previous step until `4` folds have been completed.
1. Let dough rest, covered, for `40 mins`.
1. Transfer to fridge for `12-72 hours`.

### _Notes & Comments_

- 2.5x this recipe for a half sheet pan sized pizza.
- This dough works well for `cast iron pizzas`.
- Use `flavored olive oils` for extra fanciness. I like to use a roasted garlic oil.
