## Method

1. Begin `3 hours` before planning to eat.
1. Spread olive oil in cast iron pan and `coat` dough ball.
1. Gently stretch dough to fit pan. Cover and let rest `15 mins`.
1. Stretch dough to fit pan if it has shrunk back. Cover and let rise `2 hours`.
1. Preheat oven to `450F`.
1. Sprinkle `1 cup cheese` over dough, going `edge to edge`.
1. Spoon `sauce` over cheese, then sprinkle `more cheese` over sauce.
1. Add `toppings`, a little `more cheese`, and a splash of `oil` over the top.
1. Bake `18-20 mins` or until well browned.
1. Remove from oven and check bottom crust. If not dark enough, cook on stove for a few minutes.
1. Remove pizza from pan and let rest on cooling rack `5 mins`.

### _Notes & Comments_

- Don't overdo the cheese after the base layer. The pizza may overflow. Stick to `< 1.5 cups` total.
- Keep proteins near or at the top layer to encourage crisping.
- Pineapple belongs on pizza.
