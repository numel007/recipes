_Yield: ~4 burgers_

## Method

1. Melt `butter` in a pan, then add `onions` and a pinch of `salt`.
1. Stir often while cooking on `low-med heat` until well caramelized, about `30 mins`.
1. Meanwhile, portion `ground beef` into 4 balls.
1. Thoroughly heat a cast iron pan over `med-high heat`.
1. Brush skillet with `avocado oil` and press/smash a `beef ball` into pan. Season top with `salt and pepper.`.
1. Cook `2-3 mins` and flip. Season with `salt and pepper`, then place `cheese` on top and cook additional `2-3 mins`.
1. Remove `patty` from heat and repeat with other `patties`. Make sure to `scrape off pan and re-oil` between burgers.
1. While `patties` rest, toast `brioche buns` in pan.
1. Spread `garlic spread` on top and buttom buns. Assemble in order of bottom bun -> patty -> onions -> lettuce -> top bun.

### _Notes & Comments_

- Add additional toppings as needed, such as pickles, mustard, and tomatoes.
- Serve with salad to offset the large amount of grease this burger contains.
